    "**`dd`** deletes a cell.  \n",

    "\n",
    "When you [run code](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/Running%20Code.html), the code is actually executed in a **kernel**. You can do bad thinks to a kernel: you can make it stuck in an endless loop, crash it, corrupt it, etc. And you probably will do all of these things :). So sometimes you might have to interrupt your kernel or restart it. Use the \"Kernel\" menu to restart the kernel, re-run your notebook, etc.\n",

    "Also, before submitting a homework or a project, make sure to `Restart and Run All`. This will create a clean run of your project, without any side effects that you might encounter during development.

    "\n",
    "## Storing Output\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks contain both, the input to a computation and the outputs. If you run a notebook, all the outputs generated by the code cells are also stored in the notebook. That way, you can look at notebooks also in non-interactive environments, like on [GitHub for this notebook](https://github.com/datascience-course/2018-datascience-lectures/blob/master/02-basic-python/lecture-02-notebook.ipynb). \n",
